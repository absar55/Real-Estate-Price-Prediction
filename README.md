# AI-Based Real Estate Price Prediction

---

## 🏠 Introduction

The real estate industry is undergoing rapid transformation driven by new technologies and increased capital investment. This influx signals a shift toward digital innovation in real estate services.

Traditionally, many state agents have spread wrong rumors to lure people into overpaying through high commissions. This project aims to bring transparency by providing accurate, data-driven price predictions for real estate properties.

Using a dataset of 13,000 records, this AI-powered model predicts property prices based on historical prices and key factors such as location, square footage, number of bathrooms, and BHK (bedrooms-halls-kitchen) configuration. This helps investors and buyers make informed decisions in an otherwise uncertain market.
