Accurate property valuation in the era of digital transformation
*Predict real estate prices with 90%+ accuracy using machine learning*

üåü Introduction
The real estate industry is undergoing a digital revolution, with new technologies and capital influx transforming traditional valuation methods. Our AI-powered solution addresses the critical problem of price manipulation and misinformation in property markets.

By analyzing 13,000+ property records, our system provides:

Accurate price predictions based on historical trends

Transparent valuation eliminating commission biases

Data-driven insights for buyers and sellers

Future-proof investment guidance

This machine learning project empowers users to make informed decisions by predicting property prices based on location, square footage, BHK configuration, and other key factors.

üî• Key Features
90%+ Prediction Accuracy using advanced ML algorithms

Multi-factor Analysis considering location, size, amenities

Investment Guidance identifying undervalued properties

Price Trend Visualization for informed decision-making

Robust Data Processing handling outliers and missing values

Model Comparison selecting the best algorithm for prediction

Our systematic approach ensures reliable predictions:
graph TD
    A[Data Loading] --> B[Data Cleaning]
    B --> C[Feature Engineering]
    C --> D[Dimensionality Reduction]
    D --> E[Outlier Removal]
    E --> F[One Hot Encoding]
    F --> G[Model Building]
    G --> H[Model Evaluation]

1. Data Loading & Exploration
Imported 13,000+ property records from CSV

Analyzed features: location, square footage, BHK, bathrooms, etc.

2. Data Cleaning
Handled missing values through imputation

Standardized data formats

Removed duplicate entries

3. Feature Engineering
Created location-based clusters

Calculated price per square foot

Derived property age from construction year

4. Dimensionality Reduction
Applied PCA for feature importance

Removed low-correlation features

Optimized feature set for model training

5. Outlier Removal
Identified statistical anomalies

Used IQR method to filter extreme values

Maintained data integrity while removing noise

6. One Hot Encoding
Converted categorical variables (locations)

Created binary features for ML compatibility

Preserved feature relationships

7. Model Building & Evaluation
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression, Lasso
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor

# Initialize models
models = {
    "Linear Regression": LinearRegression(),
    "Lasso": Lasso(),
    "Decision Tree": DecisionTreeRegressor()
}

# Evaluate using K-fold cross-validation
for name, model in models.items():
    scores = cross_val_score(model, X, y, cv=5)
    print(f"{name} Accuracy: {scores.mean():.2%} (¬± {scores.std():.2%})")

üìà Performance Comparison
Model	Accuracy	Advantages	Best For
Linear Regression	88.7%	Simple implementation, Fast training	Baseline predictions
Lasso Regression	90.2%	Feature selection, Handles multicollinearity	High-dimensional data
Decision Tree	92.5%	Non-linear relationships, Feature importance	Complex market patterns
